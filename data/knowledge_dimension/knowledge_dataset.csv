Demand increased with the government handing out money, and people were less likely to return to work with unemployment checks that were of increased amount and duration. So people had more money, but the supply wasnt there to meet the demand. Thus inflation. Why? Because in significant part people who had not returned to work could not produce what was needed to supply the demand. Normally, absent a government handing out cash, demand rises with production. You go back to work and earn the money to buy, but you are also participating in production, thus the production rises more or less with demand. So now UBI isnt free money, it comes from taxes, and you never get a dollar back on a dollar taxed. The US government is a terrible steward of your tax money, taking more overhead than charities do. So a 1,000 a month UBI, good for you. But taxes will be raised to cover it. Also with what people perceive to be free money, demand goes up, but supply goes down, as people need to work and produce less. Thus even more inflation.

Firstly, we are still a long long ways away from running out of work to do. People are much better than machines at many things and it will stay like that for a long time. Of course some jobs will become obsolete, but new ones will emerge. Since the industrial revolution we have been increasing productivity but, as we can all attest, we still work quite a bit and there are more of us working than ever before. If we eventually do reach a point where we are starting to run out of work to do, it's far more likely we will just all work less rather than want half of us not working and half of us working just as hard as today. Half of us working 20 hours a week is the same as all of us working 40 hours a week. Finally, it's easy to make work if needed, and the existing power structures have a lot of incentive to keep the status quo, so they'd probably rather just blow up a city so that there are construction jobs than actually have the working class end up with free time on their hands, which they could spend doing dangerous things like demanding change.

Do you just say that automatically when someone disagrees with you? Seems silly. Unintended consequences and unproductive behavior are not economic terms. But I tend to look at things as a complete picture, not in isolated chunks. Since systems are interconnected, it makes sense to look at them together. Things often cycle back as well, like for example if you cut welfare rates to save money but then there's an increase in healthcare costs because people are forced to sleep on the streets, so you actually spend more money overall. Not particularly. Sometimes yes, sometimes no, like most things. You've never heard of nepotism in the private sector? I'm incredulous. No one who hired their son to be a manager at their car dealership? No one who gave an internship to their kid's school friend? Is your argument that self serving people won't do something that benefits the people close to them? I think that's pretty obviously false, especially when it comes to parents helping their children. When you buy something, do you think that, most of the time, the person who made it was an employee or an owner? Assuming you agree that they were usually an employee, then since they have no profit motive, your argument is that they have no reason to make what you want, and so why does that thing you want exist, or at the very least, why didn't they do a really crappy job when building it? When I do work, I always try to do good work. The idea of making something that people want is very motivating. Have you ever made something? Does the idea of that not motivate you? So in your mind, is NASA trying to hire bad workers on purpose, or are they just ambivalent to the quality of worker they hire? What about when the military recruits hackers for cyber warfare?

No. Why? Because it's got to be 'universal.'

377,i0pnwii,1096,"Wealth is relevant. The fact that it doesn't impact taxes is a flaw in our tax system and speaks to my point that the rich don't pay their fair share. That's wrong. The top 1 of Americans own 40 of the country's wealth, as of 2019. It's gone up since then, likely quite significantly. And oh look, when we look at the more complete tax picture, instead of just the federal tax that you wanted to cherry pick, billionaire Americans paid 23 of their income in federal, state, and local taxes in 2018. The average American, meanwhile, paid 28. So even with our currently deeply flawed system that only looks at their reported income, we find that they are paying less as a percentage than everyone else. Even if we had a flat tax they wouldn't be paying their share! But especially as their share should reflect their ability to pay, they don't come anywhere close to pulling their weight. It said right below in your link that average rates for the bottom 50 percent fell from 4.05 percent in 2017 to 3.54 percent in 2019 and for the top 1 percent, from 26.76 percent to 25.57 percent. Did you not read your own link? Yes, the tax cuts were the point I was making. Thank you for the agreement.

And it probably makes him pretty nervous when you order that nice bottle of wine. The house you grew up in must have been harsh. When you were 2 did you have to do the same chores as your older sibling, because only equal is fair? Or was your house normal growing up and you came up with your fairness principals on your own as an adult? I wonder how much you pay in tax to have these feelings. I'm very privileged and myself and all my colleagues pay in the top tax bracket, and there's definitely a wide range of feelings at work on tax, but no one there supports a flat tax. Even the most right wing of them merely advocates for a lower rate that's still the highest rate. It would be pretty shocking for someone with as much privilege as us to think that someone living at the poverty line should pay the same percentage as we do. So I wonder if you are not repeating things you've heard on television as opposed to actually having life experience with this. If you've ever _actually_ gone out to dinner with a friend who doesn't come close financially.

Additionally, they should ensure that individual states do not violate the inherent rights of citizens.

Among those laws I would include regulations for local water, energy, and food providers to meet a certain standard, including regular inspections, to prevent poisoning or fires. Those are things that consumers can't necessarily detect and act upon until it's too late, so we need some kind of general protections. Additionally, public education. Education shouldn't be reserved for the wealthy or those with responsible, caring parents, as it is a hugely positive force for society at large. Keeping it private reduces taxes, but results in selfish, ignorant, or particularly struggling parents opting out of education for their children, which is a pretty big drag on the community.",i0wpnf2,Should universal basic income be established?,dc_1096_0,743,28,1096_c_0004,Richer_than_God,cmv,0.9922014474868774

And for education, the disagreement is either going to be that education is not a good thing, or that education rates will not drop as a result of abolishing public schools.

First, its pointless to have any laws if there is no enforcement mechanism. Second, I dont want to have to be the sole defender of my property. If I am, eventually, Im just going to use lethal force to avoid the hassle of protecting whats mine. I dont want the state regulating food and water because that necessitates a huge bureaucracy of permitting, inspection, testing, etc. If you dont like your water quality, take care of it yourself. Now, I live in a rural area where I produce the majority of my food on my farm and I produce all of my own water, so thats how Id prefer to handle it. If you live in a city, youre free to have those regulatory bodies. Im just saying I dont want it for my community.

480,i0xs888,1096,"If communities want these things and decide to use government to achieve them, they can do so. I just don't want to live in that sort of community, so I don't. That's why I'm against a lot of what the federal government does it leaves nowhere to escape to without having to emigrate to another country. First is cost. We homeschooled our two children for a year when all the schools were being retarded about covid. It costs a hell of a lot less to either educate your own children or even have a community of people sharing the load to educate a bunch of children than it does to run a fullblown public school. You can use your existing houses, you can rotate through parents on a schedule to maximize the use of their offtime from work if they have jobs, so you aren't paying a bunch of people 50100k per year. You don't have the licensing, insurance, and all the special accommodations that a government institution does. I'm going to go off on a side tangent, here... when it comes to government services, they are usually the provider of last resort, and as a result, they are bottom of the barrel in terms of quality. There's food stamps, public housing, the DMV, the post office... I'm sure there are more. In the case of food stamps and public housing, people get off of those programs as soon as they are able to. No one is trying to buy into the projects. The DMV and the post office are routinely used to denote a poor experience. No one looks forward to going to the DMV or the post office the way they may look forward to going to the apple store, for example. In the case of the DMV, there's really no alternative... but for the others, the alternatives are more or less the default. The default for getting food is going to the grocery store of your choosing and buying whatever you want and paying for it yourself. The default for housing is living in the best place you can afford. The post office is probably the default for paper mail, but for packages, it's mostly Fedex and UPS in my experience. But when it comes to education, the default is public school, which is like the project housing of education. No one questions it, or at least, they haven't. I've seen some reports that private and home schooling is on the rise after all the pandemic nonsense. I do hope people wake up to this paradox and see public school for the dregs that it is. Sure, you can get a good education at a public school. I did. You did. My kids mostly do. But the US spends almost 13k per student, per year. If people were given a choice, I think you'd see a lot of people opting out of public school. As it is now, you pay whether you use it or not, so it's kind of forced to be the default. The government can't win when people have a choice, so they force you to go along with their subpar bullshit.",i0xi1yg,Should universal basic income be established?,dc_1096_0,2803,33,1096_c_0004,ellipses1,cmv,0.9951304197311401
481,i0xvblq,1096,"Homeschooling is already allowed though, so what do you mean if given the choice? We are given the choice and most decide that the quality of education is fine and that it's not worth the very large overhead of doing all the educating yourself as an amateur educator, or manually coordinating the education of a whole community of kids. If you're going to be doing the latter, then you're basically just running a school board. The Apple store analogy is flawed because the reason you typically go to the DMV or post office is for work, the reason you go to the Apple store is for fun tech gadgets. A more analogous comparison would be going to the doctor, which people also don't enjoy despite being privatized. Or better yet, compare the experience of going to the UPS store to that of going to the post office. In my experience it's nearly identical, but maybe I've just been blessed with good post offices or subpar UPS stores.",i0xs888,Should universal basic income be established?,dc_1096_0,931,34,1096_c_0004,Richer_than_God,cmv,0.995209276676178

483,i0y14aq,1096,"But you're still reaping the benefits of having a more educated public that you wouldn't be getting if public schools weren't a thing. Can you point me to any successful examples of this kind of theoretical education system? It seems to me it's no coincidence that public schooling has been implemented across every firstworld country. It relieves the working parents from the burden of childcare and education and enables a much more productive workforce. Another point I hadn't touched on we also have private schools. If public education is so inefficient and exorbitantly expensive, why are the private schools so much more so? Are all professional education institutions just horribly inefficient, not just government ones?",i0xyr8d,Should universal basic income be established?,dc_1096_0,728,36,1096_c_0004,Richer_than_God,cmv,0.9355686902999878
484,i0y5sg3,1096,"That's assuming that it's better to have this expensive, subpar education system being the de facto norm. Also, you'd still have educated people in your populace. Those dollars that you aren't sending in for public school can be rerouted into private school or homeschool. Also, public schools may benefit from having to deal with economics and market pressures. If half of your residents pull their kid and their funding, all of a sudden, you have to be a little more judicious in how you spend the remaining dollars. Maybe you see a reduction in administrative expenses, facilities costs, and the get back to the actual business of education. Because they are marketing themselves to a very specific and narrow demographic. If you choose private school, you are already conceding that you're double paying, so that narrows your target market to people willing and able to pay 2x for something that most people regard as free. You aren't going to catch a lot of people right on the margin because they'll just give up and send their kids to public school because it's easy. So, you're left marketing to people who have excessive means. That opens up the additional benefit of your service being a Veblen good, ie., part of the perceived value is the fact that it's outrageously expensive. It's like a 1,000 dollar white tshirt. If you had the option to take your school tax money and apply it to private school, you'd see private school options become available that hit all the price points based on the top 50 of property values in a given geography. If a fat segment of people in your area pay 7,500 per year in school taxes, you're going to see myriad education options popping up for 7,500 dollars.
