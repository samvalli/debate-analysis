And that is the expected implementation, based on the current redistribution methods: the greater the earning, the greater the tax contribution, but not the greater the healthcare provided, schooling for children provided and old age pensions provided. The sensitivity of the redistributed value to earnings of the recipient provided depends on countries (old age pensions are usually more sensitive than healthcare and education), but what all usual redistributives schemes have in common is that they are institutional Robin Hood: take from the rich and give to the poor, and UBI is no exception.",1000_3_1_0000,Should we colonize Mars?,836,2,1096_0005,0.0,"['Dan Polansky', 'Danib93']",wiki
